# Java Temperature Converter

This Java program is a simple temperature converter that allows users to convert temperatures between Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin units. It takes a temperature value and units from the user and converts it to another unit based on their input.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/psyclox/java-temperature-converter.git
   ```

2. Compile the Java file:

   ```bash
   javac Main.java
   ```

3. Run the program:

   ```bash
   java Main
   ```

4. Follow the prompts to input the temperature value and units to convert from and to.

## How it Works

- The program prompts the user to input a temperature value.
- It validates the input to ensure it's a valid float number.
- Then, it asks the user to input the unit of the temperature they've entered and the unit they want to convert to.
- The conversion logic is implemented in the `convertTemperature` method.
- If the units are invalid, it prints an error message and exits the program.
